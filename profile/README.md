# üêç PyExecGo Project

**PyExecGo** is a lightweight solution for running Python scripts on any system **without requiring Python** to be installed. It packages a portable Python version and uses a simple, small, and open-source Go executable to run your Python scripts on the target machine.

This project avoids the common issues with converting or compiling Python scripts into executables, such as **triggering antivirus software**, which can cause users to be wary and potentially lead to losing customers. By keeping the Python script intact and using a minimal Go executable, PyExecGo minimizes these risks and provides a safer, more user-friendly solution.

## üöÄ Features
- **No Python installation required**: PyExecGo includes a portable version of Python.
- **Avoid antivirus flags**: Compiling Python scripts often triggers antivirus alerts, making users hesitant to run your software. PyExecGo helps you bypass this issue.
- **Small and open-source Go executable**: The Go executable is lightweight and open-source, making it easy to audit and trust.
- **Easy to use**: A Go executable handles the execution of your Python script.
- **Retain your code**: No need to compile or convert‚Äîyour Python code stays as-is.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Portable Python**: A minimal, portable Python version is bundled with the project.
2. **Go Executable**: A small, open-source Go-based executable runs your Python script by leveraging this portable Python environment.
3. **Run Anywhere**: Simply distribute the Go executable along with the portable Python files and the scripts that need to be executed in a folder, allowing hassle-free execution on any machine.

## üìù Build Your Own Project
We provide a [template repository](https://github.com/PyExecGo-Project/template) with a detailed README that guides you through the setup process. The steps are already laid out for you, but I‚Äôm working on an automatic builder to make everything even easier! If you're unfamiliar with Python or Go, we recommend waiting for further instructions or downloading one of our pre-built Python scripts/programs.

## üì¶ Pre-built Scripts/Programs
